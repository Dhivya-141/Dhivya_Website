<h1>History</h1>

<div>
<h2>When Pride began?</h2>

<p>On June 28, 1969, the Stonewall Inn was raided by the New York City police – a common police practice at the time for bars frequented by the LGBTQ+ community.1 But that night, instead of giving in, a group of brave individuals stood up. What followed were five nights of protests for LGBTQ+ rights, setting in motion the next 50 years of Pride.
After that, LGBTQ+ rights’ organizations began to spring up across the US and around the world. On June 27 and 28, 1970, the first Pride parades commemorating Stonewall took place in New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Chicago.2
Today, Pride parades span 174 cities in 46 countries worldwide,3 keeping alive the legacy of those who stood up 50 years ago. This year, Googlers in 51 locations around the world will join Pride marches to celebrate the past, present, and future of the LGBTQ+ community.
