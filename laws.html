<h1>Laws in India and Homosexuality</h1>
<div>
<p>
India has a very dynamic and progressive Constitution which in a way is the backbone of this very vast and complex nation. The Indian Constitution provides rights and protections to each and every citizen of this country whether he is in majority or in minority. The Constitution treats everyone equally without any discrimination. It is the duty of the State to ensure that no one should be discriminated against.
</p>
<p>
LGBT community persons are in minority and they too have equal constitutional rights. But their right to equality and right to get equal treatment in the society are violated on regular basis. Not only society as whole but State machinery also treat them differently, especially police. They are regular victim of rights violations. They are deprived of their basic human right and right to life which includes right to enjoy life properly.
</p>
<h2>Section 377 of IPC and Rights of LGBT community:</h2>
<p>
One of the major lacuna or contentious legal provision in our laws is Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860.
</p>
<h2>Section 377 of the IPC says:</h2>
<p>
Unnatural offences: “Whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment of either description for term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.”
Explanation: Penetration is sufficient to constitute the carnal intercourse necessary to the offense described in this section.Thus the section makes any sexual activity against the order of the nature as criminal offence. Even voluntary act of such kind is punishable. Thus consent between two persons of same gender for such activity is immaterial.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, section 377 criminalizes homosexual activity and makes it punishable with as high punishment as life imprisonment.This provision of IPC has become a major controversial point and topic of debate in recent times. People of LGBT community are trying from quite sometimes to convince and pressurize our law makers to decriminalize Section 377. In other words, LGBT social action groups are demanding that if two consenting adults of same sex are involved in homosexual activities, it should not be a criminal offence.But when their plea was not responded by our legislatures, they went to the Court for appropriate and just solution to their grievances through a Public Interest Litigation (PIL). The said PIL was filed by a NGO namely Naz Foundation in Delhi High Court.
In the case Naz Foundation v Govt. of NCT of Delhi (2009 Delhi H C) passing a landmark judgment on 2nd July 2009, Delhi High Court declared Section 377 as illegal as far as it criminalizes same sex sexual activity between two consenting adults done in private. Thus, in effect Delhi High Court, in its historic decision upheld and secured the LGBT people’s right to sexuality.
