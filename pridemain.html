<h1>Pride Love</h1>
<h2>What is Pride?</h2>
<p>
Gay pride or LGBT pride is the positive stance against discrimination and violence toward lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people to promote their self-affirmation, dignity, equality rights, increase their visibility as a social group, build community, and celebrate sexual diversity and gender variance. Pride, as opposed to shame and social stigma, is the predominant outlook that bolsters most LGBT rights movements throughout the world.
</p>
<p>
Pride takes many forms – from carnivalesque marches, to film screenings and debates – and is a moment of celebration of people who are marginalized by strict definitions of what it means to be a man or a woman. Events are organized throughout the year. Whatever the event, it’s a moment for LGBTI people to show that they are out and proud to be who they are Pride celebrates the LGBTI movement in all its diversity, and amplifies the call to respect and protect LGBTI rights.
